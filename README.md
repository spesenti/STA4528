# STA4528 - 
R code for STA4528 - Dependence Modelling with Application to Risk Management.    

This repository consists of the following `R` files:

1. `Gaussian_copula_fct.R` contains    
    
    a) `Plot_Gaussian_Copula()` plots Bivariate Gaussian copula against
        standrad uniform marginals.
        
    b) `Plot_Gaussian()` plots Bivariate Gaussian copula against
        standrad uniform marginals.
        
        
        
2. `t_fct.R` contains    
    
    a) `Plot_t_Copula()` plots Bivariate t copula against 
        standrad uniform marginals.
        
    b) `Plot_t()` plots Bivariate t copula against t marginals.
        
        
3. `Plot_copula.R` plots Gaussian and t copulas using the above functions as
   well as Archimedean copulas.
